# Relation Extraction - Initial Predictions  

This folder contains the initial predictions for relation extraction, obtained using an improved baseline model. The predictions are structured to facilitate post-evaluation with **RelCheck**.  

## ðŸ“Œ How Initial Predictions are Obtained  

The initial predictions for this project are generated using the repository:  
**Improved Baseline for Relation Extraction**  
ðŸ”— [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wzhouad/RE_improved_baseline)  

We have modified the `evaluate.py` file to output **Predictions + Confidence Scores** in a structured format. This enables easy post-evaluation using **RelCheck**.
